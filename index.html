            <br>
            <p>              
                Highly skilled software engineer with over two years of experience designing and developing complex software
                applications. Expertise in Java, Python, and SQL with a proven track record of delivering high-quality code on time and
                within budget. Passionate about solving challenging problems and collaborating with cross-functional teams to achieve
                project goals.
                               
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Currently, I'm a Lead IT Business Analyst with over 16 years of work experience in managing complex projects and driving
                business transformation initiatives and financial services. Possessing a solid ability to gather requirements, design solutions, and lead
                cross-functional teams, I am an expert in stakeholder management, process optimization, and delivering successful
                outcomes. Proven track record of achieving business objectives and exceeding client expectations through innovative
                problem-solving and effective communication.
                
                Transitioning from an IT business analyst to a full-stack developer requires a significant shift in skills and knowledge. It also acquires a
                strong foundation in programming concepts and web development technologies. During the past 2 years, I have been dedicated to learning various
                programming languages, front-end development frameworks, databases, and server-side technologies.          
                Additionally, I have built my portfolio, repositories of personal projects, and contributed to open-source projects to gain practical
                experience and showcase my skills to potential employers/ clients.

                <br>
                During my free time, 18 years ago, I founded "Bring Happy," a nonprofit organization that organizes events for sick
                children in hospitals.
                Bring Happy is dedicated to bringing joy and happiness to sick children in hospitals through organizing various events
                and activities such as art and craft workshops, storytelling sessions, and music concerts. Their goal is to provide a
                positive and uplifting environment for the children, helping to alleviate the stress and anxiety that often comes with
                being hospitalized.
                We have shared some needed sunshine and brought happiness to more than 10,000 children.
